DATA SORTING VISUALIZER
------------------------

TODO:
everything

Bugs:
Program closes after running draw_element_array() because it is missing dimension paramters

NOTES:
When checking when to update display, only update graph areas.
Trying to update the whole canvas causes buttons and everything to flicker

MatPlotLib cannot be cleanly placed within a pygame window.
To work around this, just create rough draft on the window and then create a seperate window for matplotlib

Add parameters to draw_element_array
Sorting Demos will draw each step to the screen. 
Normal sorting methods will output to a file/matplotlib
